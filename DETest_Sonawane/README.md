# DETest

#Approach:

1. Pandas dataframe Approach:
--Please replace CSV file paths in python scripts.
--ProcessCSVFile.py shows how to convert csv file to HTML using pandas dataframe.
--ProcessPRNFile.py shows how to convert prn files to csv first and convert it to HTML format.
--outputfiles folder contains HTML output files and csv file generated from prn file.

2. AWS Glue Approach:
--Set up IAM role access
--create dev endpoint
--process csv file using Jupyter notebooks
--For using Spark processing capabilities for big data files we can use this approach along with approach 1.

3.  Spark Approach:
--Setup Spark locally and process CSV files using spark dataframes.

## Why?

We are interested in your skills as a developer. As part of our assessment, we want to see your code.

## Instructions

In this repo, you'll find two files, Workbook2.csv and Workbook2.prn. These files need to be converted to a HTML format by the code you deliver. Please consider your work as a proof of concept for a system that can keep track of credit limits from several sources.

This repository is created specially for you, so you can push anything you like. Please update this README to provide instructions, notes and/or comments for us.

## The Constraints

Please complete the test within 5 business days. Use either Java, Scala or Python. Use any libs / tools you like. For a Data Engineering position using spark is recommended.

## Questions?

If you have any questions please send an email to rsayag@eclassifiedsgroup.com.

## Finished?

Please send an email to rsayag@eclassifiedsgroup.com let us know you're done.

Good Luck!
